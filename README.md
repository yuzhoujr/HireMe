##Algorithm Preparation
#####End Goal: Finish 70% of Coding practice on lintcode
**For Each Algorithm Problem, use the following rubric**
* Understanding how and why the solution works. 
* What's the motivation behind the problem
* How could you use it to solve real-world problems? 
* What are the insights, the clever observations made on the problem's constraints that make the solution possible? 
* What details of the problem does the solution take advantage of to get that extra performance gain / space saving? 
* Where does the algorithm / data-structure / solution suck? How could you make it better? 
* What do you lose and gain by doing so? 
* For the specific problem at hand, which solution presents the most acceptable trade-offs?
